# The Erlang Diaries - Synchronous and Asynchronous Calls

## Purpose

At the begining stages of working with Erlang you will want to communicate.  With Erlang OTP you can make asyhchronous and synchronous calls using OTP `behaviour(gen-server)`.

This addition of *The Erlang Diaries* will show you how to create synchronous and asynchronous calls.

## Warming Up

### Getting Erlang

You will need Erlang, if you don't already have it installed.  You can find the latest installations and instructions on the [Erlang website](http://www.erlang.org/download.html).

Once erlang is installed type in the following command, and confirm the output:

```
$ erl
EShell V6.3 
```

### Creating a Project

Create a new project stub using rebar.  For more information on Rebar see [/2015-03-05-The-Erlang-Diaries---Installing-rebar]().  Here are the steps:
rebar create-app='poke'
