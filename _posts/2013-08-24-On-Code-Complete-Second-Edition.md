#Overview

I picked up this book after looking over [Jeff Atwood's recommended reading list](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/recommended-reading-for-developers.html).  Code Complete Second Edition was written by Steve McConnel and was published in 2004.  Although, some of the material is dated it, it is still a comprehensive guide to writing good, clean, quality, software.  I put it up there with Robert C. Martin's ("Uncle Bob") book Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.  

Mr. McConnel briefly talks about requirements gathering, and design, but the main focus is about constructing/developing software.  This book stood out to me by the shear volume of quotes, research, references, and additional resources provided after and during every section.  In today's day and age of software development, I found the metaphor of "constructing/engineering a house" repetitive and cliche, however the content is spot on.

#On Collaboration - (Section 21)

#On Pair Programming


#On "Inspection" techniques

#On Testing - (Section 22)

Mr McConnel provides insights into how testing fits into the "construction" phase.  He also dives into the question of whether testing proves a program is correct.  In addition to, where and how developers should focus there testing effort
 
Here are some statistics that stood out:
Causes of Errors - (Section 22.4.3)
    95% - Programmer errors
    2% - Systems Software(OS,etc)
    2% - Other Software (third party)
    1% - Hardware
