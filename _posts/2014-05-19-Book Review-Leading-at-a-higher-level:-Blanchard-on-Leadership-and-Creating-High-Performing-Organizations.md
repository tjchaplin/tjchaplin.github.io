# Seletion

Ken Blanchard has an exhaustive amount of Published books.  Based on good reviews from Amazon, I decided to pick this one up.  From the back cover, it appeared to encapsulate a joining point of his other books.

# Main Points

The book focuses on types of leadership, and how **high performing** oganizations work with these types of leadership.

The types of leadership discussed include:

* Self Leadership
* One on one Leadership
* Team Leadership
* Organization Leadership

The *main point* was how people are the engine behind business.  Empowering people in the right way to 'use their brains', helping them setting clear goals, and leading them in a way that fosters growth, are the keys to 'Leading at a higher level'

I think it is summed up in this quote from the book:

> Leadership is not something you do to people, but something you do with people

# Was it great?

No.  There were some good points in the book, however the author continually referenced himself.  

> It felt as though I was reading an infomertial for Ken Blanchard.

# Takeaways

Below are some of the points I thought were worth jotting down:

## Situational Leadership

The below types of leadership should be used based on the experience and situation of the people being led: 

* Direction
* Coaching
* Supporting
* Delegation

He uses the analagoy of teaching your child how to ride a bike.  Each stage needs different support.

## Assumed Constraints
Constraints that we empose on ourselves.  The author uses an analogy of a baby elephant, who belongs to the circus being tied to a chain.  When the elephant grows up it won't break the chains, eventhough it could easily, because of **assumed constraints**.

## Sources of power

* Position
* Task
* Personal
* Relationship
* Knowledge

## Smart Goals

* **S** - Specific and Measurable
* **M** - Motivating
* **A** - Attainable
* **R** - Relevant
* **T** - trackable and time bound

Author asks the following question we coming up with goals: "Can you imagine training for the Olympics with no one telling you how fast you ran or how high you jumped?"

## Reprimanding

1. Reprimand as soon as possible
2. Be specific
3. Share your feelings
4. Reaffirm - they are doing a good job

Sequential list of concerns people go through when dealing with change:

1. Information Concerns - use a directing style leadership

5. Collaboration Concerns - Use a supporting style of leadership
